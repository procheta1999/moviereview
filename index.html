        The Shawshank
        Redemption:It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but "The Shawshank
        Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us
        vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's
        calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper
        than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.<img id="img"
            src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDFkYTc0MGEtZmNhMC00ZDIzLWFmNTEtODM1ZmRlYWMwMWFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg"
            style="width:400px;height:400px;margin-left:15px;"> <br>Roger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy.
        Two
        opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow
        the dialogue instead of anticipating it. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a
        subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls
        another man's description of the crime.

            Principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe is no help at all.
            3 Idiots is a coming-age comedy and inspirational film directed by Rajkumar
            Hirani. The story of the film is similar to that of the famous novel Five Point
            Someone by Chetan Bhagat. This film is based on our Indian educational system
            which pressurizes the students and has an obsession for high grades. Aamir Khan
            as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue
            their passion and make a career out of it. R.Madhavan as Farhan who wants to
            become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of
            his strict father.

            Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his
            family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict
            college director who is highly competitive. Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the
            role of virus’s daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan . The film goes very
            smooth. The film’s first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the
            professor, Chatur’s speech and mournful meal at Raju’s home. Overall the film
            depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors
            and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing.
            The back ground music supports the film all through the movie. Overall dipiction
            is fine. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent.Its
            definitely a one time watch
